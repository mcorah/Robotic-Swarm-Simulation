Robotic Swarm Simulator - Micah Corah
	Created using C++ and Qt

Build instructions:
	qmake
	make

Run:
	./swarm_sim

Description:
	This is a simulation of a robotic swarm. The robots have
	the goal of sorting a field of colored boxes into piles.
	Robots can pick up one box at a time and are only aware of
	what is in their sensor radius. However, there are some
	consructive behaviors that allow robots to create a model
	of their environment. At the beginning a field is generated
	according to entered parameters. Robots then follow selected
	parameters when run. Keep in mind that behavior settings
	are dynamic. All of these can be changed as the simulation
	is run.

Use:
	Run:					-run simulation, generating if necessary
	Play speed:				-set run speed
	Step Simulation:		-step simulation, generating if necessary
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	#Robots:				-number robots created at generation
	Sensor Radius:			-robot sensor radius
	#Boxes:					-number of boxes created at generation
	#Colors:				-number of colors of boxes
	Generate Field:			-generate field with current settings
	------------------------------------------------------------------
Robot Behavior:
Basic:
	Pick Up:				-allow robots to pick up boxes
	Box Drop:				-robots drop boxes when finding a similar box
	Robots Drop:			-drop when a similarly colored robots is
							encountered, pile size requirement when enabled
	Secondary Detection:	-detection and motion towards robots that see boxes
	Avoid Robots:			-avoid robots when without a box
	Color Congregation:		-when with box robots move toward similarly colored
							robots, pile size requirement also exists when enabled
	Motion Randomization:	-move randomly, required to start simulation
	------------------------------------------------------------------
Constructive:
	Pile Size Tracking:		-track number and max of each color box visible
	Impurity Counting:		-subtract differently colored boxes in size tracking
	Pile Location Tracking:
		Standard Tracking:	-track location of piles, stored on robot
		Data Sharing:		-robots allowed to share pile size and location
		Central Tracking:	-size and location of largest pile, stored by
							behavior algorithm, information gleaned from temp
							size,  location	and max size copied to each robot
